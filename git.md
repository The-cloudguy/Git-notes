# Git

-   git is Distributed Version Control System.

-   3 statges : 
    -   Working Area
    -   Staging/Index Area
    -   Local Repo/Git Database

-   Distributed version control system means all code will be stored to all nodes(clients).

-   Repository is the place where all code will be stored and which have capability to store versions.

-  git will only see files. If new folder will created, git will not consider folders.

-  Newely created file will consider as **untracked files** and those have no history stored in local repo.

-  **Modified** means it has history which is stored already and now any new change happend in existing file.

-  **Deleted** means file is deleted from repository but its version is stored in local repo.

-  In git we add changes not files.

-  Every changes moved from staging Area to Local Repo is called **COMMIT**

-  Every Commit has ID

-  Using Git we can move to any commit in History

-  **HEAD** is commit id where working Tree is pointing at.

-  Branch is a independent line of development in a project or sprint.

-  **Merge** means bringing changes from one branch to another branch. 2 types **FastForward** and **Merge**

-  **FastForward** - When no extra commit has done by parent and we want to merge from child into parent at that time **FF** is used.

-  **Merge** -- We have created fearure branch from master and If any commit has made by master, at that if we want to merge from feature into master then that time new merged commit will be created.

-  **Rebase** is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

- **cherry-pick** -- sometimes it happend that some branch has certain change which we wanted into our branch. In that case we can cherry-pick(copy) that commit to our branch.

- **revert** -- it will revert back to that commit ID and make an entry of that revert change in git history. It will delete the file.

- **reset**
    - **soft** - it will revert back to that commit but will keep the change in staging area
    - **hard** - it will revert back to that commit and will delete file

-  **git diff** to view difference between two branches if you are adding then it will show + and if you delete something it will show 
    - it can give difference between two commit ID as well

-  **git cat-file** to view parent and tree and blob detail of commit

-  **git stash** it will save changes from index area so you can work someother part then when needed you can pop it back.

-  **git bisect** This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your projectâ€™s history introduced a bug. it can be used to find the commit that changed any property of your project

-  **git tag** used to tag perticular commit to release versions

-  **git blame** the display of author metadata attached to specific committed lines in a file. This is used to examine specific points of a file's history and get context as to who the last author was that modified the line. This is used to explore the history of specific code and answer questions about what, how, and why the code was added to a repository

-  **git reflog** Git keeps track of updates to the tip of branches using a mechanism called reference logs, or "reflogs."
